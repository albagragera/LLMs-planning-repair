The gripper-strips domain is a simple environment where an agent named Robby, equipped with a gripper, can move around two rooms named "rooma" and "roomb" and pick up and drop off three balls named "ball1", "ball2", and "ball3". The domain involves reasoning about the location of Robby, balls, and the gripper, and ensuring that the gripper is free when it needs to pick up a ball and that it carries a ball when it needs to drop it off.

The available actions are move, pick, and drop. The move action allows Robby to move from one room to another, the pick action allows Robby to pick up a ball located in a particular room, and the drop action allows Robby to drop off a ball that he is currently carrying.

The move action updates Robby's location to the new room, the pick action updates the state to indicate that the gripper is now carrying the ball and the ball is no longer in the room, and the drop action updates the state to indicate that the gripper is no longer carrying the ball and the ball is now located in the specified room.

The move action can only be executed if Robby is currently located in the source room and the destination room is specified as a parameter. The pick action can only be executed if Robby is located in the same room as the ball, the gripper is free, and the ball is not already being carried by the gripper. The drop action can only be executed if Robby is located in the same room as the ball is to be dropped off, the gripper is carrying the ball, and the ball is not already in the room.

To make the task solvable, the pick and drop actions must also update the location of the gripper. The pick action should update the state to indicate that the gripper is no longer free and is now carrying the ball, while the drop action should update the state to indicate that the gripper is now free and no longer carrying the ball. With these additional effects, Robby will be able to move all three balls to room roomb by reasoning about the location of the balls and the rooms, and planning a sequence of actions that will move the balls to the desired location while respecting the restrictions over the actions.
