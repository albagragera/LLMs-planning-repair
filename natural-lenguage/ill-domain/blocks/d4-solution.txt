The blocks world is a problem in artificial intelligence where the agent needs to move blocks on a table. The agent can pick up, put down, stack, and unstack blocks. The available actions have some restrictions. The pick-up action requires that the block is clear, on the table, and the agent's hand is empty. The put-down action requires that the agent is holding a block. The stack action requires that the block being held is being placed on top of a clear block. The unstack action requires that the block being picked up is on top of another block that is clear, and the agent's hand is empty. Additionally, the block being picked up is no longer on top of the other block after the action is executed.

The problem involves four blocks: b1, b2, b3, and b4. At the beginning, b1 and b2 are on the table. B3 is on top of b2, b4 is on top of b3, b1 is clear, and b4 is clear. The goal is to have b1 on top of b3 and b3 on top of b4.

To make the task solvable, the effects of the pick-up, put-down, stack, and unstack actions should be updated. After the pick-up action is executed, the block is in the agent's hand, and the agent's hand is not empty. After the put-down action is executed, the block is on the table, it is clear, and it is not being held by the agent anymore. After the stack action is executed, the block that was being held is no longer being held, it is no longer clear, it is on top of the other block, and the block underneath is not clear anymore. After the unstack action is executed, the block that was on top of the other block is being held by the agent, it is not clear anymore, the block it was on is clear, and the block being held is no longer on top of the other block.
