## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized  natural language processing (NLP), enabling human-like text generation, question answering, and translation. On the other hand, Automated Planning (AP) is a problem solving technique that provides a solution plan to achieve desired goals when applied to specific initial states, given a complete formal model description of the task. Despite claims of LLMs having reasoning capabilities, empirical evidence reveals their shortcomings in tasks such as plan generation, plan reuse or replanning, making them unable to fully replace AI planners. In this work, we present an empirical study that shows the limitations of LLMs in another task requiring reasoning and planning skills: that of fixing ill-defined planning tasks. Experimental results across different planning tasks show that, despite not being useful as standalone reasoners, LLMs have some potential as tools that assist humans in the process of fixing ill-defined planning tasks.
