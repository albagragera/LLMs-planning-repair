# LLMs-planning-repair

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper titled "Exploring the Limitations of using Large Language Models to Fix Planning Tasks", published at the KEPS Workshop at ICAPS 2023.


## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized  natural language processing (NLP), enabling human-like text generation, question answering, and translation. Despite claims of emergent reasoning capabilities, it has been demonstrated their lack of planning skills in tasks such as plan generation, plan reuse or replanning. In this work, we present ongoing efforts on exploring the limitations of LLMs in another task requiring reasoning and planning competences: that of assisting humans in the process of fixing planning tasks.
